Chapter 2: Discourse

This chapter discusses rhetoric and its uses. 

The first and most important rule of rhetoric is that standards and rules must be universal. 

The second rule is that rhetoric from an individual regaurding a group that they are not a member of should be disregaurded.
It does not matter how right or wrong the rhetoric is, if the one saying it is not from that group, they ought not be regaurded.
If somebody from the group in question says the exact same thing that the outsider is saying, 
the rhetoric now has weight enough to mean something.
