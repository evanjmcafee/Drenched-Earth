Chapter 5: Value

"For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil" 1 Timothy 6:10, New International Version, the Bible

It is a shameful spectacle that this quote is seems to be lost on people today, especially among my fellow Christians.
Look at the evil that people are willing to do for money today. It has always been this way. Even in the Bible. Judas sold
jesus out for 30 pieces of silver. Today that is about $340 USD by weight. 

What people fail to realize is that money is only the vector for value. When you realize this, you are free. 

If you Barter and trade in property, you cant be taxed. As long as its not gold or some precious material or something, it cannot be taxed. You can also decide
what something is worth to you. Then no taxable transaction was made.
